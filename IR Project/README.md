# Description :
Infrared Sensor Module has built-in IR transmitter and IR receiver that sends out IR rays and looks for reflected IR rays to detect presence of any obstacle in front of the sensor module.
The module has on board potentiometer that lets user adjust detection range.The sensor has very good and stable response even in ambient light or in complete darkness.

- *Vcc* :	3.3 to 5 Vdc Supply Input
- *Gnd* :	Ground Input
- *Out* :	Output that goes low when obstacle is in range
- *Power LED* :	Illuminates when power is applied
- *Obstacle LED*	: Illuminates when obstacle is detected
- *Distance Adjust* :	Adjust detection distance. CCW decreases distance.
- *CW increases* : distance.
- *IR Emitter* : Infrared emitter LED
- *IR Receiver* :	Infrared receiver that receives signal transmitted by Infrared emitter.
